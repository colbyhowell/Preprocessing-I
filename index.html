    <h2>What Can I Do?</h2>

    <p>I am a dedicated worker with a lot of energy and drive that has pushed me to the point I am in life. I graduated from the University of Louisiana at Lafayette, where I studied broadcasting with a minor focus in English. This proved to go nowhere considering I began working in tech right out of college. What started as a journey into basic marketing has since become a rewarding career in web marketing, light front end development, search engine optimization, and customer service. Colby-Jack of all trades is how I refer to myself sometimes.</p>
